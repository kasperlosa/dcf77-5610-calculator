# DCF77 Signal Strength Calculator

## Overview

The DCF77 Signal Strength Calculator is a web application designed to help users determine the quality of the DCF77 time signal reception based on their geographical location. It is specifically intended for use with the Casio G-Shock 5610U watch, but it can be used with different watches aswell. The application provides a map displaying the range of the DCF77 station and calculates signal strength and optimal synchronization times.

## Features

- Map visualization of the DCF77 station's signal range
- Address or coordinates input to determine signal strength
- Information on synchronization times and tips
- Restricted area detection (Japan, Korea, USA excluding Alaska and Hawaii)
